    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Named after an ancient Chinese statesman, poet and gourmand of the Song
      Dynasty, the pork belly is cooked three different ways, rendering the meat
      succulent, tender and very flavorful. (If you can't find pork belly, ask
      the butcher; it is what bacon is before it is cured and sliced.)
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound raw pork belly</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>¼ cup light soy sauce</li>
      <li>¼ cup dark soy sauce</li>
      <li>½ cup Chinese rice cooking wine</li>
      <li>3 ½ ounces Chinese rock sugar</li>
      <li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated</li>
      <li>8 spring onions, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Slice the pork belly into 2-inch wide strips. Bring a large pot of water
        to a boil, and stir in the pork slices; reduce heat to a simmer, and
        cook the meat for 10 minutes. Remove from the water, and blot dry with
        paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a large wok, and brown
        the pork strips well on all sides. Pork will splatter - use a splatter
        shield for this step.
      </li>
      <li>
        While pork is browning, mix together the light soy sauce, dark soy
        sauce, rice wine, rock sugar, ginger, and spring onions in a large soup
        pot or stockpot. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring to dissolve the
        sugar. Reduce heat to a gentle simmer, and lay the pork strips into the
        liquid. Cover, and simmer until the meat is very tender, 1 1/2 to 2
        hours. Add water as needed to keep the liquid from going completely dry.
