    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add chicken broth to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over
        medium-high. Remove from heat and add dried chiles. Cover and let sit
        until chiles have softened, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven
        over medium-high. Add 3 of the onion quarters, reserving the last
        quarter for later use, and garlic to pan. Cook, flipping once, until
        charred, about 6 minutes. Remove from heat (do not wipe out the pot),
        and transfer onion and garlic to a blender. Add chicken broth, chiles,
        tomatoes, vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt, cumin, oregano, pepper, and cloves.
        Secure lid on blender, and remove center piece to allow steam to escape.
        Place a clean towel over opening. Process until combined, about 1 to 2
        minutes. Pour through a fine mesh strainer into a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season chicken with remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Add remaining 1
        tablespoon oil in to the large pot; heat over medium-high. Add chicken;
        cook, flipping once, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side. Pour
        blended chile mixture over meat chicken and top with bay leaf. Cover and
        cook over medium-low until chicken is cooked through, about 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Meanwhile, chop remaining onion quarter. Set aside.</li>
      <li>
        Uncover pot, discard bay leaf, and remove chicken from chile mixture and
        shred. Transfer shredded chicken to a large bowl and top with 1 cup of
        the chile mixture; leave remaining mixture in the Dutch oven pot over
        medium-low.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over
        medium-high. Working with 1 tortilla at a time, quickly dip tortilla
        into sauce until well coated. Transfer to skillet and top with 1/4 cup
        of the chicken. Repeat process with as many tortillas as will fit on in
        skillet. Cook until tortillas are golden brown and beginning to crisp, 1
        to 2 minutes. Fold tortillas in half and transfer to a plate. Repeat
        process with remaining sauce, meat chicken and tortillas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide tacos evenly among 6 plates. Top with reserved chopped onion and
        cilantro and serve with lime wedges.
